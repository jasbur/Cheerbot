This is a 3D model made in Blender to be 3D printed and used in conjuntion with
the code in the `pi_code` directory and a Raspberry Pi to create a complete
Cheerbot that dances and everything!

There is room in the base for a Raspberry Pi 3 to be mounted and sockets for two
"SG90 9G Micro Servos" to animate the head and arm.
