Cheerbot is a robot that cheers when the team your team scores! It consists of a
Python 3 script and a Blender 3D model suitable for 3D printing.

Directories:

"pi_code" = This is the directory where the main program lives. Simply run the
`cheerbot_bootstrapper.py` script and Cheerbot will cheer for whichever team you
have specified as the `team` object in the `cheerbot.py` script!

"blender_model" = This is the directory where the 3D printable Cheerbot model is
stored. You can feel free to tweak it, or just export it into a format that your
slicer will understand.
